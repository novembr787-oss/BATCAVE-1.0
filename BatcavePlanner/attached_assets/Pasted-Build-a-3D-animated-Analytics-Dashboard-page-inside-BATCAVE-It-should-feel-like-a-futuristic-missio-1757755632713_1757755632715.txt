Build a 3D animated Analytics Dashboard page inside BATCAVE. It should feel like a futuristic mission-control readout inside the Batcave — cinematic, sleek, and immersive.

Layout & Structure

Collapsible Sidebar (left): Consistent with app-wide sidebar (Dashboard, Plan, Calendar, Settings, Customize).

Main Analytics Grid (right):

Header: “Mission Analytics” title with glowing underline animation.

Sections:

Weekly Performance (3D bar chart)

Monthly Overview (radar/spider chart)

Yearly Insights (circular time-distribution chart)

XP & Streak Tracker (animated progress rings)

Chart Requirements

Use Recharts (or D3/Three.js if possible) for base chart rendering.

Wrap with GSAP + Framer Motion for cinematic animations.

1. Weekly Performance (3D Bar Chart)

Bars rise upward with staggered GSAP animations.

Each bar has glowing edges, subtle reflection, and hover tooltip.

Axis labels slide in from sides.

2. Monthly Overview (Radar/Spider Chart)

Categories: Tasks, Goals, Focus, Consistency, XP.

Spider web animates outward from center with easing.

Data points pulse on load, lines glow faintly.

3. Yearly Insights (Circular Time Chart)

12 arcs (months) forming a glowing ring.

As data loads, arcs grow outward with bounce easing.

Hover → arc expands slightly, tooltip fades in.

4. XP & Streak Tracker

Circular rings that fill smoothly.

GSAP draws rings with “strokeDasharray” animation.

Streak counter → number rolls up with odometer effect.

Animations (GSAP + Framer Motion)

Page Load:

Sidebar expands, Analytics grid cards stagger in.

Charts:

Bars: rise with bounce.

Spider web: radial growth.

Circular charts: draw-on animation.

Hover Effects:

Cards lift with depth shadow + neon glow.

Micro-Interactions:

Hover tooltips fade/scale.

Buttons pulse gently on hover.

Style Guide

Theme: Default = “Dark Knight” (deep black, electric blue accents).

Cards: Glassmorphism with glowing borders.

Fonts: Orbitron (titles), Inter (body text).

Icons: Lucide-react with neon glow filters.

Interactivity

Dropdown at top-right → switch between Weekly / Monthly / Yearly views.

Toggle: Table Mode (renders same data in clean table).

Export Button → stub (future: CSV/Excel/PDF).

Backend / API Integration (Stubbed)

Charts load placeholder mock data unless Supabase is connected.

If Supabase connected → fetch real user task/goals data.
