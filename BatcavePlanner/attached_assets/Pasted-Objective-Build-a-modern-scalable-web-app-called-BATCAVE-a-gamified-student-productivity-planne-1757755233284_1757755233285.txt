Objective:
Build a modern, scalable web app called BATCAVE — a gamified student productivity planner with cinematic animations, immersive UI, and AI-powered planning.

🔧 Architecture & Stack

Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript

Styling: TailwindCSS + custom gradients

Animations: GSAP + Framer Motion (cinema-level, After Effects style)

Backend/Auth/Data: Supabase

AI Assistant (ALFRED): Gemini 2.5 pro via backend proxy

Deployment: Vercel or Netlify

⚠️ Instruction:
Do NOT generate real Supabase schemas or hardcode keys.
Instead, generate a setup wizard that asks the user to paste their API keys:

SUPABASE_URL

SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

GEMINI_API_KEY
Store them in .env and import via env.ts.


BATCAVE should feel like a cinematic, immersive productivity HQ, not a kiddie app. The animations should be cinema-grade, like After Effects but real-time in React using GSAP + Framer Motion. Fonts and themes should scream Batcave aura — dark, sleek, powerful.

Here’s the breakdown, ready to use:

🖥️ DASHBOARD 

“Build the Dashboard as the command center of BATCAVE.

Layout: collapsible sidebar (left) + main dashboard grid (right).

Cards: Today’s Tasks, XP Progress, Upcoming Events, Weekly Goals.

Animations:

GSAP stagger fade/slide for cards on load.

Framer Motion hover glow + parallax depth on cards.

Radar-style subtle sweeping background behind cards.

Style: glassmorphism + neon gradient edges. Feels like mission control.”

📅 PLAN 
“Build a Planning tab /plan.

Views: Week 1-5, Month, Quarter, Year.

Domain-aware forms (athletics, Islamic, academics, custom).

Dynamic sub-options (e.g., Surah auto-name, exercise reps/sets, etc.).

Drag & drop tasks onto timeline.

Animations:

Smooth GSAP transitions between views.

Tasks pop in with scale + glow.

Timeline slides with physics-like easing.”

🤖 ALFRED 

“Build ALFRED, the AI assistant panel.

Collapsible panel from right, summon with hotkey (CTRL+Space).

Chat UI with Markdown rendering, code blocks, task suggestion buttons.

Voice input (optional).

Animations:

Panel slides in with GSAP elastic easing.

Messages fade/scale like holograms.

Branding: Alfred = sleek butler vibe, responses with subtle personality.

Backend hook: proxy to Gemini.

🎨 CUSTOMIZATION CONSOLE 

“Build a Customization Console /customize.

Options: Themes, Fonts, Gamification Style (Sapling vs Mountain).

Live preview panel.

Theme presets (see theme prompt).

Animations:

Console opens like a holographic dashboard.

Preview elements morph live with GSAP.

Store settings in Supabase for user persistence.”

⚙️ SETTINGS 

“Build Settings /settings.

Profile management (name, avatar, email).

Toggle gamification style: Sapling 🌱 OR Mountain 🏔️ (exclusive).

Toggle accessibility (reduced motion, high contrast).

Animations:

GSAP switch toggles with smooth morph.

Save success → checkmark pulse.”

📆 CALENDAR 

“Build Calendar /calendar.

Views: Month, Week, Day.

Drag and drop tasks/events.

Smooth scroll between weeks/months.

Animations:

Events grow/shrink into position with GSAP.

Page flip animation between months (subtle).

Style: futuristic holo-calendar, glowing edges.”

🎬 GSAP 

“Integrate GSAP + Framer Motion at cinematic level (After Effects vibe).

Dashboard cards: stagger fade/slide.

XP bar: fluid fill with bounce-out ease.

Sapling: GSAP timeline scaling + leaf sway.

Mountain: marker climbs with bezier path animation.

Radar background: GSAP infinite rotation + fading sweep.

Charts: bars grow upward, 3D rotation reveals.

Micro-interactions: hover pulses, button taps, card lift on hover.”

🌱 vs 🏔 GAMIFICATION SELECTION 

“Gamification should be exclusive. In Settings, user chooses Sapling Growth 🌱 or Mountain Climb 🏔.

Only one renders on Dashboard at a time.

Persist user choice in Supabase.

Animate smooth transition when switching styles (fade out → fade in).”

📂 SIDEBAR PROMPT

“Build collapsible sidebar.

Sections: Dashboard, Analytics, Plan, Calendar, Settings, Customize.

Icons: Lucide/Phosphor icons.

Collapsed = icons only, expanded = icons + labels.

Animations:

Sidebar expands/collapses with GSAP width morph.

Active link glows + pulses softly.”

🔠 FONT 

“Make fonts selectable in Customization Console. Options:

Cyberpunk: ‘Orbitron’, neon + futuristic.

Black Ops: military tactical.

Space Grotesk: minimal sci-fi.

JetBrains Mono: tech/numbers.

Inter: clean body text.
Fonts applied globally via Tailwind plugin.”

🎨 THEME 

“Make selectable themes in BATCAVE.

Dark Knight: deep blacks + electric blue edges.

Neon Grid: magenta/cyan neon, retro-futuristic.

Stealth Ops: matte black, red accents, tactical vibe.

Aurora: flowing gradients (green/blue/purple).

Minimal White: soft white + gray, clean mode.
User can toggle theme → instantly applied with GSAP fade/morph.”

🦇 THE BATCAVE VIBE

Overall BATCAVE should feel like:

Mission control + futuristic cave.

Dark, minimal, glowing edges, cinematic transitions.

Animations = buttery smooth, After Effects quality.

Fonts + themes = mood-shifters.

Every element = immersive, but still productivity-first.
