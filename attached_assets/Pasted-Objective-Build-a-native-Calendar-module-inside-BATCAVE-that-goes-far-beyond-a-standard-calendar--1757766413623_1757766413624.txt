Objective:
Build a native Calendar module inside BATCAVE that goes far beyond a standard calendar. It should feel like a Batcave mission-planning holo-table: fluid, animated, highly interactive, and deeply integrated with tasks, goals, and events.

Layout & Structure

Dedicated Calendar Page (/calendar) + accessible via Sidebar.

Views:

Month View → grid of days with tasks/events indicators.

Week View → horizontal timeline with daily breakdown.

Day View → hour-by-hour schedule with drag-and-drop tasks.

Quick Add Bar → create task/event inline on any day.

Hover Details → hover on a task/event shows preview card (title, tags, due time).

Integration:

Tasks auto-sync here.

Goals show milestone markers.

Events displayed as colored blocks with category tags.

Animations (GSAP + Framer Motion)

Page Entrance:

Background glows in with subtle circular radar sweep animation.

Calendar grid fades in cell by cell (staggered).

Switch View (Month ↔ Week ↔ Day):

Smooth morph animation (GSAP timeline scaling & sliding cells).

Add Task/Event:

Expands from a glowing cursor ripple, then slots into calendar with bounce easing.

Drag-and-Drop:

Ghost preview follows cursor, drops into slot with elastic animation.

Event Hover:

Detail card slides up softly with glowing border.

Completed Task:

Smooth fade + checkmark sweep animation on that day.

Features & Interactivity

Drag & Drop Scheduling:

Move tasks between days/weeks.

Color-Coded Categories:

Academics, Athletics, Personal, Faith, etc.

Filters:

Toggle visibility of tasks/events by category or priority.

Quarters Planning Mode:

Special 4-section grid (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).

High-level goals/events mapped here.

Recurring Events:

Simple repeat (daily, weekly, monthly).

Smart Suggestions:

ALFRED can suggest “best times” for study, workouts, etc.

Styling & Vibe

Theme: Futuristic holo-grid with Batcave colors: matte black background, glowing neon blue/purple highlights.

Cards: Glassmorphism with subtle reflections.

Fonts:

Headers: Orbitron or Rajdhani.

Body: Inter.

Optional 3D:

Hover tilt effect on day cells.

Charts/weekly bars rendered with Recharts + Three.js for 3D depth.

Backend Integration (Supabase)

Schema:

events: id, user_id, title, description, category, start_time, end_time, recurrence.

tasks: (linked by due_date).

API Calls:

CRUD events.

Sync with tasks/goals.

Auth:

Events tied to user_id (private).

Deliverables

/calendar page with animated views (month/week/day/quarter).

Interactive drag-and-drop scheduling.

Task/event CRUD with Supabase integration.

Hover detail cards + filters.

Smooth transitions via GSAP + Framer Motion.

Alfred integration (optional: “Schedule this task” button pushes task into calendar automatically).

Final Vibe

This Calendar should not feel like Google Calendar. It should feel like:

You’re Bruce Wayne staring at a mission holo-table.

Days, weeks, months = grids of glowing mission slots.

Every animation = sleek, cinematic, after-effects level polish.

When you complete something, it should feel earned (like a batcomputer confirming a mission update).
